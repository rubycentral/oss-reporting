# Update 2024-05

## Organizations

* User discovery with Rails Core team
* Feedback meeting with PyPI regarding their rollout of organizations
* Project kick-off and team selected
* PyPI provided some valuable before-you-start feedback: "get your authorization system organized because it's going to get much more complex and it's painful to fix after". We have started work cleaning up the rubygems.org authorization system.

Next steps:

* Design for organization flows
* Add maintainer role (an admin without control over ownership) for all gems, regardless of organization
* Iterate on permissions behavior, organization flows, and modeling
* Write code

## Audit

* SoW is ready, signing this week.

Next steps:

* Onboard ToB team and start audit process.
