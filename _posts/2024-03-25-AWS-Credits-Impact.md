# Quantifying the value of AWS credits

RubyGems.org is the single, centralized repository of shared packages, known as “gems”, for the entire Ruby programming language. The Ruby language (and RubyGems.org) is used daily by companies like AWS, Stripe, Shopify, Airbnb, GitHub and Cisco to build the software used internally and by their customers.

* For the last 15 years, RubyGems.org has been hosted on AWS. During those 15 years, we have served over 160 billion gems to users around the world, including tens of billions of gems to AWS customers.
* In 2023, RubyGems.org served over 2.75 billion gems to over 10 million unique IPs every month.
* The majority of software written in Ruby is hosted on AWS, directly or indirectly, and the AWS SDK gem is the second-most used package in the Ruby language, where it is 2.4x more downloaded than the “rails” gem.
* Installs of AWS SDK gems are roughly 10% of all gem installs from RubyGems.org.
* Today’s web-based ecosystem, including both companies and open source projects, would not exist without Ruby and RubyGems.
* RubyGems would not exist today without the support that AWS has provided over the years. In the early years, AWS credits made up more than half of the total project support.
* AWS itself uses Ruby internally for many tools and RubyGems.org is a source of pre-built software that Amazon engineers use in their work on a daily basis.

## RubyGems.org metrics:
