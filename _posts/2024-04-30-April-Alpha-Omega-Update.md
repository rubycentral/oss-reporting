# Update 2024-04

The in-person round table at OSSummit was great and helped us get to know more of our peers in the package management space.
We are already grateful for these connections which inspired us to improve our usage policy and spawned collaborations with OSTIF and PyPI on the initiatives below.

## Organizations

* Onboarded a Project Manager
* PRFAQ (Press Release / FAQ) document created which describes what the feature should look like when released.
* Requirements document started with an outline to be filled during product discovery.
* Conducted a product discovery meeting with AWS SDK team. They reviewed and commented on the PRFAQ, then met with us to discuss the feature.
* Schedule product discovery with PyPI team to learn about their own experience releasing organizations on PyPI.

Next steps:

* Meet with PyPI
* Finalize requirements
* Design iteration with our user interface designer
* Start writing some initial data model code

## Audit

* Contract and Statement of Work received from Trail of Bits on April 26th.
* Current SoW, as proposed, is too large. We plan to refine and narrow the scope to fit within budget.
* Started conversation with OSTIF who has offered to coordinate with us and review the scope of the audit to help contain the budget.

Next steps:

* Narrow scope and finalize Statement of Work
* Sign contract and onboard Trail of Bits team
